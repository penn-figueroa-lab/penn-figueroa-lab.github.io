Welcome to the Figueroa (Human-Centered) Robotics Lab!

The research in our group centers on developing the **physical and perceptual adaptive intelligence** needed for robots to learn from and interact with humans while being able to adapt to a wide-range of capabilities and needs. We seek to enable able-bodied humans to teach robots cumbersome dexterous manipulation tasks in factories and at home in the most efficient way possible *(minimal human effort)*. We also focus on mobility-impaired humans that require physical assistance in simple activities of daily living, from reaching, lifting and carrying objects to targeted physical therapy exercises and rehabilitation. 

In particular, we develop tightly coupled **learning, control and estimation algorithms to achieve fluid human-robot collaborative autonomy with safety, efficiency and robustness guarantees**. This involves research at the intersection of machine learning, control theory, perception, biomechanics and psychology - combined through a physical human-robot interaction perspective.
